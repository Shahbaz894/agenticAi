Technology Stack
PhiData API:
The core backend for retrieving and processing financial data. The PhiData-powered AI models are utilized for intelligent analysis.

Groq Model:
A powerful AI model designed for processing complex data and generating insights for various use cases, such as financial analysis.

YFinance Tools:
Integrates the YFinance library for fetching real-time financial data, including stock prices, company profiles, income statements, and more.

DuckDuckGo:

Python:
The primary programming language for building the Financial Insights Agent.

How It Works
Initialization:
The agent is initialized with a set of financial tools and a pre-trained AI model from Groq to handle natural language queries and financial data processing.

Data Retrieval:
Once a user queries the agent, the system interacts with various tools such as YFinanceTools and external APIs to gather relevant data.

Data Processing & Analysis:
The financial data is processed using machine learning models and presented in a structured format. The agent then analyzes the data to provide actionable insights.

Output Generation:
The agent returns the information in a concise and easily digestible format, including key financial ratios, technical indicators, and investment recommendations.

Installation & Setup
Step 1: Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Shahbaz894/agenticAi.git
cd financial-insights-agent
Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment
It is recommended to use a virtual environment for this project.

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Step 3: Install Dependencies
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 4: Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the project root directory and add your PhiData API Key:

bash
Copy code
PHI_API_KEY=your_phidata_api_key_here
Step 5: Run the Agent
bash
Copy code
python financial_agent.py
Usage
Run the agent by executing financial_agent.py.
Once the agent is running, you can interact with it by asking questions about companies, their stock prices, income statements, and other financial metrics.
The agent will return detailed responses based on the available data.
Example query:

"What's the current stock price of Apple?"
"Show me the income statement for Tesla."
"Give me key financial ratios for Microsoft."
